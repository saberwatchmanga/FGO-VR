# AstroQuest

**ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission (PS4 / PlayStation VR) in virtual reality on Meta Quest 3**, played
from your own copy of the game through a PS4 emulator. Two ways to play:

- **On the headset alone**: an app for the Quest 3 runs the emulator on the headset itself. No
  PC is needed once it is installed. Please note: while the standalone Meta Quest 3 build is
  fully functional and playable, the headset’s mobile GPU is pushed to its limits. As a result,
  native standalone visuals run at lower resolutions and visual fidelity compared to the original
  PS4 hardware or the PC VR mode.
- **On a Windows PC, shown in the Quest through Virtual Desktop**: the PC runs the game at the
  console's 60 frames a second and at up to six times its resolution.

The emulator is [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4) (its ARM64 build,
[zenithblue-oss/shadps4-arm64](https://github.com/zenithblue-oss/shadps4-arm64), on the
headset), to which this project adds what the game needs from a PlayStation VR: the headset,
its tracking and reprojection, the camera's view of the controller (taken from the Quest's
hand tracking), the 3D sound engine, the microphone, and fixes for the game's timing and
resolution under emulation.

> **No game files are included or distributed.** You need your own copy of ASTRO BOT Rescue
> Mission, dumped from your own PlayStation 4.

## Status

Work in progress, built and tested by one person on one Quest 3 and one PC. World 1 & 2has been 
played through on the Quest 3 on its own; the PC path has been played
over Virtual Desktop and fixed since. Expect rough edges, and please report what you find.

## What you need

- **A Meta Quest 3.** (The Quest 3S has the same chip and should work, but nobody has tried.)
- **A PS5 DualSense controller.** It stands in for the PS4 controller the game expects:
  buttons, sticks, touchpad, motion sensors, rumble and light bar. (A DualShock 4 may work
  too; untested.) On the PC the Quest's own Touch controllers can stand in for it.
- **ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission, European release CUSA12392, version 1.00**, dumped from your own
  console and game: either as the game's folder (the one with `eboot.bin`, `sce_sys`,
  `sce_module` in it, about 13 GB) or as the `.pkg` package made from the dump, which the PC
  launcher unpacks by itself. (A package downloaded from the PlayStation Store is encrypted
  and cannot be used.) Other regions and versions are untested, and the fixes for the game's
  timing and resolution only apply to this one.
- To install on the headset: a computer with
  [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) (or
  [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/)) and the headset in
  [developer mode](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/#enable-developer-mode)
  (set in the Meta Horizon app on your phone; on Windows, adb may also need Meta's ADB
  driver, described on the same page).
- To play on the PC: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit), a graphics card with Vulkan 1.3, 16 GB of
  memory or more (the emulator asks Windows for about 14 GB), the
  [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
  (the launcher says so if it is missing), and [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/)
  (the app on the Quest, the Streamer on the PC).

## Installing: Quest 3 on its own

Download `AstroQuest-<version>-Quest3.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/bigmak94/AstroQuest/releases/latest), then:

1. **Install the app.** Connect the headset to the computer with a USB cable, allow USB
   debugging in the headset, and run

   ```sh
   adb install -r AstroQuest-0.13-Quest3.apk
   ```

   (or drag the APK onto SideQuest).
2. **Copy the game to the headset**, the folder named `CUSA12392` (this takes a few minutes):

   ```sh
   adb push CUSA12392 /data/local/tmp/astro/games/
   ```

   The app also finds it in `/sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files/games/CUSA12392`,
   but that folder is deleted with the app if it is ever uninstalled.

   **If your game is a `.pkg` file**, unpack it on a PC first: the headset needs the game's
   folder. Two ways:

   - **The easy one, on Windows**: download `AstroQuest-<version>-PC-VR-Windows.zip` from the
     same release, unzip it, put your `.pkg` in its `games` folder and start
     `Play Astro Bot VR.bat`. It offers to unpack the package (about a minute, 13 GB); you can
     close it after that. `games\CUSA12392` is then the folder to copy to the headset. You do
     not need Virtual Desktop or a VR-ready PC for this.
   - **By hand, with the tool it uses**: [PkgTool](https://github.com/maxton/LibOrbisPkg/releases/tag/v0.2)
     (`PkgTool-0.2.231.zip`, free and open source; Windows, or the `PkgTool.Core` builds for
     Linux and macOS). `PkgTool pkg_extract --passcode 00000000000000000000000000000000 game.pkg out`
     puts the game in `out/uroot`: rename that folder `CUSA12392`. Then add the game's
     description, which the package keeps apart: `PkgTool pkg_listentries game.pkg` shows the
     number of `PARAM_SFO`, and `PkgTool pkg_extractentry game.pkg <number> CUSA12392/sce_sys/param.sfo`
     writes it. Without `param.sfo` the emulator does not recognise the game.

   Either way, only a package made from a dump of the game can be unpacked; one downloaded
   from the PlayStation Store is encrypted.
3. **Pair the DualSense with the headset**: Settings > Bluetooth > Pair, and on the
   controller hold Create and the PS button until the light bar flashes.
4. **Start "Astro VR Host"** from the App Library, under *Unknown Sources*. The first start
   takes a few seconds longer (it unpacks the emulator) and asks for the microphone: the game
   listens to it for blowing at things, as it did with PlayStation VR's.

Playing:

- Put the Touch controllers aside and hold the DualSense: the headset tracks your hands around
  it, and that is where the controller is in the game.
- The first screen asks to move the controller into a floating outline: hold it up in front
  of you where the outline is.
- On the world map, **look** at a planet and press ✕.
- **Reset the view** by holding OPTIONS for a second (or pressing the PS button) whenever you
  sit differently and things are too close, too far or off to one side.
- Taking the headset off pauses the game.
- Settings (refresh rate, resolution, field of view, sharpening, microphone gain...) go in
  `/sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files/vrhost.txt`; all of them are explained in
  [README-QUEST-VR.md](README-QUEST-VR.md).

Your saves are kept in `/sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files/data/shadPS4/home/1000/savedata`.
Updating the app with `adb install -r` keeps them; **uninstalling deletes them**, so copy that
folder off the headset first (`adb pull`).

## Installing: PC VR through Virtual Desktop

Download `AstroQuest-<version>-PC-VR-Windows.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/bigmak94/AstroQuest/releases/latest), then:

1. **Unzip it** into a folder with a short path, e.g. `C:\Games\AstroQuest`. Some of the
   game's files have long names, and the emulator cannot open a file whose full path is
   longer than Windows' 260 characters: keep the path of the folder that holds `games` under
   about 110 characters.
2. **Put your copy of the game in its `games` folder**, anywhere in it: the game's folder
   (the one with `eboot.bin` in it) or its `.pkg` file. A package is unpacked the first time
   you start, which takes a minute or so and about 13 GB. You can also leave the game where
   it is: when the launcher finds none, a window asks where it is and remembers the answer.
3. **Set up Virtual Desktop**: install the Streamer on the PC and, in its Options, choose
   **VDXR** as the OpenXR runtime. In the headset, in Virtual Desktop's Streaming settings,
   set the frame rate to **120** (the game then runs at 60 frames a second, as on the console).
4. **Connect the DualSense to the PC**, by USB cable or by Bluetooth paired with the PC, not
   with the headset: paired with the headset, it reaches the PC without motion sensors or
   touchpad. With no gamepad on the PC, the Touch controllers play instead.
5. **Connect to the PC with Virtual Desktop**, then start **`Play Astro Bot VR.bat`** on the
   desktop you see in the headset. The first time, it offers to unpack the game if it is a
   package (or asks where the game is). Then a small window lets you choose each eye's resolution, the
   frame rate and the field of view; Play starts the game, and the headset switches to it
   after a few seconds.

For the controller to be placed by your hands, turn on hand tracking in the headset and let
Virtual Desktop forward tracking data to the PC. The Touch controller layout, all settings and
what to do when something does not work are in [README-PC-VR.md](README-PC-VR.md).

## Building from source

Clone with the submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bigmak94/AstroQuest.git
```

Everything builds on Windows from Git Bash, without admin rights, with a portable toolchain
kept in `tools/` (not in the repository): LLVM/clang 21 (`tools/llvm`), CMake 4.4
(`tools/cmake`), Ninja (`tools/ninja`) and the MSVC CRT and Windows SDK fetched with
[xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin) (`tools/winsdk`).

- **PC build**: `source tools/env-win.sh && cmake --build build/win-x64 --target shadps4`, then
  `bash tools/make-pc-vr.sh` puts it in `pc-vr/`.
- **Quest app**: `bash tools/build-arm64.sh` cross-compiles the emulator for the headset
  (Debian 13 arm64 sysroot made by `tools/mk-sysroot.mjs`, FEXCore built by the upstream
  `shadps4-arm64-main/runtime/scripts/build-fexcore-smoke-aarch64.sh`), then
  `bash quest-host/build.sh` builds the APK. That needs the Android SDK (build-tools 36.1,
  platform 36), an NDK, a JDK, the
  [Khronos OpenXR loader for Android 1.1.63](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/khronos/openxr/openxr_loader_for_android/1.1.63/)
  (the `.aar` unzipped into `tools/openxr`), and the
  [Bachata S4 v0.2.4](https://github.com/JICA98/Bachata-S4/releases/tag/v0.2.4) release APK
  (`bachatas4-0.2.4-release.apk`, SHA-256 `4077b0d0b80e354c71eff1ce2c003f122449ac266eb27a6ac26744d3f9809a08`)
  in the top folder, whose Linux runtime (glibc, its libraries and the Turnip Vulkan driver)
  the app carries.
- `bash tools/make-release.sh <version>` packs the release files into `build/release/`. It
  puts [PkgTool 0.2.231](https://github.com/maxton/LibOrbisPkg/releases/tag/v0.2), unzipped
  into `tools/pkgtool`, in the PC package: the launcher unpacks a game package with it.

How it all works, and the tools used to test it on the headset and with a simulated one, is
described in [README-QUEST-VR.md](README-QUEST-VR.md) and [README-PC-VR.md](README-PC-VR.md).
