# Astro Bot Rescue Mission on Meta Quest 3 — what is in this folder

This folder holds a work-in-progress port of the `shadps4-arm64` PS4 emulator core to immersive VR
on Meta Quest, built around one game: ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission (CUSA12392).

| Folder / file | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `shadps4-arm64-main/` | The emulator core (fork of shadPS4 with a FEX x86-64 CPU backend), with the PSVR emulation and the sound engine added here |
| `quest-host/` | New Quest app: OpenXR presenter + launcher for the core (`com.astrobotquest.vrhost`) |
| `tools/` | Portable toolchain (clang, CMake, Ninja, Windows SDK, Debian arm64 sysroot) and helper scripts |
| `games/CUSA12392/` | The game, extracted from the PKG |
| `build/win-x64/` | Windows x64 build of the core, used to develop and test on this PC |
| `build/arm64/` | The core cross-compiled for the headset (aarch64 Linux/glibc) |
| `build/quest/astro-vr-host.apk` | The app to install on the headset |
| `pc-vr/`, `Play Astro Bot VR.bat` | The other way to play: the emulator runs on this PC and the headset shows it through Virtual Desktop. Everything about it is in `README-PC-VR.md` |

**App 0.10 (2026-10-03 afternoon): the light.** Everything lit by the game's light probes
other than the first was lit from the wrong faces: a level keeps its probes in one cube-map
array, and AMD hardware takes the layer of a cube array as face + 8 x cube while the
emulator's array has six faces to a cube; the emulator passed the number on unchanged. In
level 1-4 the ground, lit by the third probe, read layers past the last and came out black;
everything else lit by a later probe (rock in shade, the controller, Astro) came out darker
or in the wrong colour - in every level, not only 1-4. Fixed in the shader translator
(`FixCubeCoords`); the canyon of 1-4 now shows its red earth and green plants.

**App 0.11 (2026-10-03): the first release on GitHub.** On the headset it does what 0.10
does; it is built from the published source, which by then also had the PC's field-of-view
changes (`README-PC-VR.md`), which the headset app does not use. From 0.11 on the app is
signed with the project's own key: over a build signed with the Android debug key (0.10 and
before) it only installs after that one is uninstalled, which deletes its saves - copy the
`savedata` folder off the headset first.

**App 0.12 (2026-10-03)**: the same app again. What changed is the PC's launcher, which finds
the game in its `games` folder, unpacks a `.pkg` by itself and asks where the game is when it
finds none (`README-PC-VR.md`). The folder it unpacks is also what the headset needs.

**App 0.13 (2026-10-03)**: the same app once more. What changed is on the PC: the sound no
longer stays silent after Virtual Desktop took its sound device away and brought it back
(`README-PC-VR.md`).

**App 0.8 (2026-10-03)**, after the fourth session (levels 1-1 to 1-3 played, the game stopped
on entering 1-4 twice):

- **The crash at level 1-4 ("Cliffhanger")**: the level is the first to draw with a geometry
  shader fed with a triangle fan, a kind of primitive the emulator's shader compiler had no
  case for; it stopped on purpose there (`spirv_emit_context.cpp: NumVertices: Unreachable
  code!`, the emulator ends with signal 5). Fans, polygons, line loops and the strips with
  adjacency are handled now; 1-4 loads and plays on the PC and in the headset's sandbox with
  the player's own save. The controller's vibration just before is the game's: what the game
  asks of the motors lasts a second at most once the emulator is gone.
- **Saves**: the game could miss its save at start (the adventure began anew; it happened on
  the PC every time, here only by luck of timing): the emulator handed the game the player's
  login before the game had started the user service. Fixed; see `README-PC-VR.md`.
- **Head-butting**: the headset's position reaches the game (every ten seconds core.log says
  where it has the head: it follows the player's), and from 0.8 the emulator also works out
  how fast the head moves where the headset's system does not say, since the game only takes
  a push of the head for one above some speed.
- **`fov=`**: a narrower field of view than the PlayStation VR's for a sharper picture (see
  the settings below). In 0.8 it defaulted to the console's own, so nothing changed unless
  set; **app 0.9 (same day) makes 85% the default**: 18% more pixels to the degree.

## How it fits together

```
Quest 3
└─ Astro VR Host (Android app, OpenXR)
   ├─ shows the stereo frames as a projection layer; the compositor reprojects them to the
   │  current head pose every refresh, like PSVR's own reprojection did
   ├─ sends the head pose (and lens distance) to the core every display refresh
   ├─ maps a Bluetooth DualSense to the DualShock 4 the game expects: buttons, sticks,
   │  triggers, touchpad and motion sensors in; rumble and light bar colour out
   ├─ places that controller in the game: from the hands the headset sees holding it when it
   │  can, otherwise at a fixed spot in front of the player, turned by its motion sensors
   ├─ plays the sound (one audio stream per port the game uses)
   └─ starts the emulator core as a child process ──► shadps4 (aarch64 Linux, glibc)
                                                       ├─ FEX runs the game's x86-64 code
                                                       ├─ Turnip (Mesa) Vulkan driver on the Adreno GPU
                                                       ├─ emulated PSVR: HMD, tracker, camera,
                                                       │  reprojection, social screen
                                                       └─ sound: native Ngs2 engine, 3D audio,
                                                          7.1 rendered for the ear speakers
```

Frames travel from the core to the app in shared GPU buffers (AHardwareBuffer / dma-buf), poses and
controller data over unix sockets, audio over a third socket.

## Building

Everything builds on this Windows PC from Git Bash, no admin rights, WSL or Android Studio project:

```sh
source tools/env-win.sh && cmake --build build/win-x64 --target shadps4   # PC test build
bash tools/build-arm64.sh                                                  # core for the headset
bash quest-host/build.sh                                                   # APK
```

`quest-host/build.sh` takes the Linux runtime the core needs (glibc, its loader, the Turnip driver)
out of `bachatas4-0.2.4-release.apk`, which therefore has to stay in this folder.

## Installing and running

```sh
adb install -r build/quest/astro-vr-host.apk
adb push games/CUSA12392 /data/local/tmp/astro/games/        # 13 GB, a few minutes
```

Pair the DualSense with the headset (Settings ▸ Bluetooth; hold Create + PS until the light bar
flashes), then start **Astro VR Host** from the app library (Unknown Sources). A floating panel
reports what the app is doing, and which controller it found, until the game's first frame arrives.
(The headset's own controllers count as gamepads too, and were what the app took for the
controller in the third session: the game then gets buttons and sticks from the DualSense but
neither its motion sensors nor rumble or light bar. From 0.7 on a controller of Sony's make goes
first whenever it shows up, and the controller is the one input actually comes from.)
Put the Touch controllers aside: with them out of the way the headset tracks your hands, which is
what places the DualSense in the game.

In the game:

- The first screen asks to move the controller into a floating outline. Hold the DualSense up in
  front of you, where the outline is. (If the headset does not see your hands, the controller is
  assumed to be there and the screen passes on its own.)
- The world map is selected by **looking** at a planet and pressing ✕.
- Touchpad: the DualSense's own. If the system does not hand it over, the right stick stands in
  for the finger (flick it) and Create for the click.
- **Resetting the view**: hold OPTIONS for a second (as on a PlayStation VR), or press the PS
  button. Where your head is then is where you sit as far as the game goes, and the way you face
  is straight ahead; the controller's heading is taken anew as well. The app does it by itself
  when ✕ is pressed for the first time, and when the headset's own "reset view" is used (hold the
  Meta button). Do it again whenever you have settled differently and things are too close, too
  far or off to a side: the game takes its bearings only when it is told to (see "Where the
  player sits").
- Taking the headset off pauses the game; putting it back on resumes it.
- If the headset's boundary lights up, you are near its edge: besides being in the way, the
  boundary costs the GPU time the game needs. A boundary with more room around the seat avoids
  it.

Optional settings go in `/sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files/vrhost.txt`, one
`key=value` per line:

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `refresh_rate=72` | display refresh rate to ask for (72, 80, 90, 120; default 90). It decides which frame rates the game can keep in step with the display: 45 or 30 frames a second at 90 Hz, 36 at 72, 40 at 80, 60, 40 or 30 at 120, see "Speed" |
| `pace=2` | how many refreshes of the display every frame of the game is given. `2` is the game's own way, as up to version 0.6; a larger number holds it to that. Default: the emulator chooses, see "Speed" |
| `resolution=960` | the size the game draws its scene at, per eye: `816` (x870), `960` (x1080), `1200` (x1280), `1440` (x1536), or `game` for the game's own choice. Default: the emulator chooses, as large as the GPU manages at the pace, see "Speed" |
| `antialias=0` | leave edges as jagged as the game draws them without multisampling. Default: the emulator smooths them, see "The picture" |
| `real_time=0` | let the game count time in frames as on the console: slow motion whenever a frame takes longer than 1/60 s. Default: the emulator has it run by the clock, see "Speed" |
| `hands=0` | do not use hand tracking; the controller stays at its fixed spot |
| `sharpen=0` | no sharpening of the picture. Default 1: the emulator sharpens every frame of the game once. 2: the headset's Super Resolution filter on every refresh instead (finer; about a twentieth of the GPU's time). 3: that filter whenever the system finds the GPU has time for it (in a level: hardly ever). 4: the headset's plainer filter. See "The picture" |
| `cubic=1` | have the headset enlarge the picture with a cubic filter instead of a linear one (sharper, for some GPU time on every refresh) |
| `stick_touchpad=0` | right stick no longer doubles as a finger on the touchpad |
| `motion=0`, `rumble=0` | ignore the motion sensors / no vibration |
| `msaa=4` | let the game multisample as on the console (default 1 = off, much faster) |
| `stats=1` | keep a small panel in view with the game's frame rate, the display's refresh rate and whether the hands holding the controller are seen |
| `predict_ms=25` | how far beyond the next refresh the head pose given to the game is predicted (0–80). More if the picture's edges show when turning the head, less if the world wobbles |
| `dynamic_resolution=0` | do not ask the system what size it recommends for the picture (which may cost the GPU its fastest clock). `2`: also show the picture at that size, as up to version 0.6. Default: ask, and show the picture at full size, see "The picture" |
| `cpu_boost=0` | do not ask for the processor's "boost" level (its fastest clock, which the system grants for the first 45 seconds and up to a fifth of the time after) |
| `fov=100` | how much of PlayStation VR's field of view the game draws, in percent (50–120). **Default 85 since app 0.9**: about 91 by 94 degrees an eye instead of 100 by 103, the same pixels over fewer degrees, so 18% more of them to the degree, with a black border where the rest was (it costs the GPU nothing). `100` is what the game draws on a PlayStation VR (50.4°/49.8° out/in, 51.6° up and down an eye); `80` or `75` sharper still and narrower. host.log says what was used ("the game draws 85% of PlayStation VR's field of view") |
| `mic=0` | the game does not get to hear the headset's microphone (see "Microphone") |
| `mic_gain=2` | make what the game hears that many times louder (0.1–30) |
| `arg=...`, `env=NAME=value` | extra emulator argument / environment variable |

What a session leaves behind, in the same folder as `vrhost.txt`:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `host.log` | the app's own log: settings, controller found and what it offers, the OpenXR session, and every ten seconds a line with the game's frame rate against the display's, the processor time and memory the emulator used and the cores it ran on, a line on where the head is in the headset's own space and how far it moved, a line on what was seen of the hands and where the controller was taken to be, every reset of the view and what asked for it, the VR runtime's own counters ("runtime:": GPU load, the compositor's time, frames it had to repeat, load per processor core), and how loud the microphone was |
| `core.log` | the emulator's output, with a few lines every five to ten seconds on the frame rate and what a frame's time goes to, on how each sound port keeps up and on what the game's microphone port heard; "The title's clock" (how long frames take, the time step the game is given, the speed it ran at, the size it draws at, how many refreshes a frame is given and how busy the GPU was), "The scene is drawn at" and "Frames are given ... refreshes" (every change of size and of pace, and why), "The title has the player's seat at" (where the game takes the player to sit and where the head is from there: near zero when the view is right), "Seat recentred" (every reset of the view), "The headset refreshes ... after the host's display" (how the emulated headset keeps step with the real one) |
| `host.prev.log`, `core.prev.log` | the same of the start before the last one |

`adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.astrobotquest.vrhost/files/host.log` fetches one; they are
what to look at (or send along) when something did not work. `adb logcat -s AstroVR` shows the
host's log live. The emulator's own folder (saves, `sys_modules`) is `.../files/data/shadPS4/`.

## Where the player sits

The game takes the place of the player's head once, from the first position the tracker gives
it a few seconds after it starts, and from then on places everything around that spot; it never
asks which way the player faces, because a PlayStation VR player faces the camera. It takes
stock again only when the console says the view was reset, or when OPTIONS is held. (Not when a
level starts: with the head half a metre forward of where it was at the start, the PC build
loads the first level and stays half a metre forward.) On the Quest the first position is
wherever the head was a few seconds after the app was started, in a space whose origin and
heading are the headset system's affair. In the second session that put the player ahead of
where the game meant them to be for the whole session: the hero stays 0.4 to 1.1 m in front of
that spot, so less than half a metre is enough to stand on top of him.

The emulator now keeps the player's seat itself (`src/core/vr/vr_runtime.cpp`): the position and
heading of the head at the moment the view was last reset. What the game is given is counted
from there, and with every reset it is sent what the console sends, so that it takes stock too.
The view is reset when the first pose arrives, when the game first asks for one, when ✕ is
pressed for the first time (the player has settled, controller in hand, looking at the title),
when OPTIONS is held for a second or the PS button is pressed, and when the headset's own reset
is used. `core.log` says each time where the seat is, and every ten seconds where the game takes
the player to sit and where the head is from there.

## Speed

**The game counts time in frames.** It moves its world on by a sixtieth of a second for every
frame it draws, however long the frame took. On the console that is the same thing; here it is
not, and in the first two sessions the whole game ran at little more than half its speed (30 to
35 frames a second). The emulator now gives it, frame by frame, the time its frames really take
(the engine keeps its step in three variables, written by the one function that sets its frame
rate; `src/core/known_title.cpp`). Slowed down to 43, 30 and 22 frames a second, the PC build
then follows the same course to the second as at 60, and a scripted walk through the first level
has the hero in the same places at the same moments. Below 20 frames a second the game slows
down rather than take steps its physics were never tried with. `real_time=0` turns this off.

**Two refreshes for a frame, or three.** The game draws a frame for every two refreshes of its
headset (60 frames for the 120 Hz of a PlayStation VR) when it manages. When a frame takes
longer it goes straight on to the next one, at whatever rate that makes, and that rate has
nothing to do with the display's: at 33 frames a second on a display of 72 Hz one frame is on
show for two refreshes, the next for three, as they happen to fall, and whatever moves in the
picture moves in jerks. That is what the first level was like up to version 0.6.

The emulated headset refreshes with the Quest's display. The app tells the emulator of every
refresh; the emulated headset keeps step with those and refreshes at the moment after them that
has the game's frames arrive midway between two looks of the app (a clock of its own would
drift against the display). From 0.7 on it refreshes more slowly than the display wherever the
game cannot keep the display's pace: one and a half times as slowly, so that the game's two
refreshes are three of the display's. The app asks for 90 Hz now. That makes 45 frames a second
where the game manages a frame in two refreshes (title, menus, world map, lighter scenes) and
30 where it takes three (the levels), and either way every frame is on show for exactly as long
as the next. In the self-test, with a display and a compositor of 90 Hz standing in, 292 to 300
of 300 frames stay for exactly three refreshes in the first level's ordinary views, and 87 to
96 of 100 in its heaviest. Head movement is smooth at the display's rate regardless: the
compositor turns the last frame to where the head points by now.

Frames are never given more refreshes than still makes 30 frames a second: a game that cannot
do that either is left to draw as fast as it can. At `refresh_rate=72` and `80` there is
therefore only the one pace (36 and 40 frames a second), and the levels run beside the display
as they did; at `120` there are three (60, 40 and 30). `pace=` holds the game to one number of
refreshes throughout.

(What does not work is holding a finished frame back until its refresh: the game does not wait
for its frames to be shown, so they pile up behind the one that is held - a tenth of a second
late on the PC, seconds on the headset. The first attempt did that.)

**The size of the picture.** The game draws its scene at one of four sizes (816x870, 960x1080,
1200x1280 or 1440x1536 an eye; a base PlayStation 4 moves between the last three, and only goes
down to the first in a few levels), enlarges it to 1440x1536 itself and hands that to the
headset. It chooses the size by how long it finds the GPU to take over a frame, and emulated,
the clock it reads for that says how long the emulator took to pass the drawing on, not how
long the GPU needs for it. The emulator therefore chooses in its place, pace and size together
(`Governor` in `src/core/known_title.cpp`). It looks eight times a refresh whether the GPU
still has work of the game's before it, and goes by that and by how long frames take:

- frames that fit the refreshes they are given take exactly that long, on average; frames that
  take 3% longer do not fit;
- the pace is the fastest at which 960x1080, the console's own smallest, fits the GPU's time
  with a tenth to spare. Only at the slowest pace there is (30 frames a second) will 816x870 do;
- the size is the largest that fits the pace with 15% to spare, by what the sizes were seen to
  cost (the three larger ones are counted as 8%, 27% and 54% more GPU time than 816x870, the
  upper end of what was measured);
- when frames stop fitting and the GPU is what holds them up (busy 85% of the time or more), it
  goes straight to the size, and if need be the pace, that the GPU's time says will fit; when
  it is the game's own work that takes long, to the next pace;
- a step up, in size or in pace, that had to be taken back within seconds makes the next one
  wait twice as long (6 seconds to 2 minutes), and counts the size as dearer.

Up to 0.6 the size went back and forth between 816x870 and 960x1080 all through the first
level (fourteen times in six minutes of the third session): at 72 Hz the smaller one used 78 to
94% of the GPU's time and the larger one did not fit. With three refreshes of 90 Hz for a frame
there is room. In the self-test's first level (GPU at 690 MHz, compositor stand-in at 90 Hz):
1200x1280 at 30 frames a second with the GPU busy 78% of the time in its ordinary views, 816x870
at 30 with the GPU busy 97 to 99% in its heaviest (the whole level in view), 1440x1536 at 45 in
the world map. A session has a slower GPU clock (599 MHz): expect the heaviest views to fall a
little short of 30 there, and the ordinary ones at 960x1080 to 1200x1280. `resolution=` holds
the game to one size, `resolution=game` leaves the choice to the game.

Measured on a Quest 3 in the first level, without the headset worn (`tools/quest-sandbox-test.sh`):
about 30 frames a second before the changes below; after them 59 at the start of the level (860
draws per frame) and 40 to 42 looking down the whole level (1800 draws), where GPU and processor
are both at their limit. A real session differs: the emulator has three processor cores of its
own there (3 to 5, at 1.92 GHz), the GPU runs at 599 MHz at most (690 in the sandbox), and the
compositor takes 0.7 to 1 ms of it at every refresh. The second session (app 0.5, at 120 Hz):
40 to 56 frames a second in the prologue, 21 to 40 in the first level, with the GPU 97 to 99%
busy and the emulator using two of its three cores. The third (app 0.6, at 72 Hz): 33 to 36 in
most of the level and 24 to 32 at its start, at the game's proper speed. The self-test can
stand in for that: `HOST_COMPOSITOR=90` among its settings takes the GPU away from the emulator
the way the compositor does, which makes the GPU the limit there too (its frame rates times
0.87 for the slower clock are about what a session gets), and `tools/quest-level-bench.sh` runs
it into the first level that way.

Three programs share the GPU in a session: the emulator, this app (which copies each finished
picture to where the compositor takes it from) and the compositor. Left to itself the driver
treats the first two as equals, and the app's millisecond of copying then waits behind everything
the emulator has queued for the pictures after it: in that first session up to 54 ms, with the
app's own frame loop down to 42 rounds a second. The emulator's GPU work therefore runs at the
lowest of the kernel driver's priority levels (`KGSL_COMPAT_PRIORITY=12`, set by the app; the
Mesa driver has no way to ask for that itself, the library that sits between it and the kernel
does it). In the self-test, with the GPU kept busy by 4x multisampling, the copy went from 15 to
38 ms on average (76 at worst) to 1.5 ms (9 at worst), and the game got 15% more frames out.

What made the difference, in the core (`shadps4-arm64-main`):

- The frame's GPU commands are handed to the driver in parts while the frame is still being
  translated, not all at once at its end, so that the GPU works at the same time as the thread
  that feeds it (`SHADPS4_FLUSH_DRAWS`, 64 draws by default on the headset build).
- Images are created with the list of formats they will be viewed in. Without it Turnip has to
  store every colour image uncompressed and untiled.
- A render pass is no longer ended by a change that does not need it (a target that has just
  been cleared, depth writes being switched off and on): 113 passes per frame became 52.
- Per-draw work of the GPU thread that only repeated itself is remembered (fetch shader layout,
  texture descriptions and lookups, image layout transitions), and a pipeline that is already
  bound is not bound again (which made the driver resend its state to the GPU).
- A finished frame is flipped when the GPU is done with it, not at the next refresh.
- The emulator has more busy threads than the headset has cores for it. The sound thread and the
  two threads every frame passes through get a higher priority than the game's helpers
  (`SHADPS4_THREAD_NICE`, set by the app). (The VR runtime's own thread hints are not available
  for them: it only accepts threads of the app's process, and the emulator is a process of its
  own.)
- The GPU driver draws directly instead of in tiles (`TU_DEBUG=sysmem`, set by the app while
  multisampling is off).

What is left is what the game draws. Looking down the first level that is about 8 million
vertices a frame (shadow maps a third, a depth pass for each eye a fifth, the two colour passes
the rest), in 1850 draws; `SHADPS4_FRAME_STATS=1` logs the count, `=2` lists it pass by pass.
With every draw cut down to one triangle (`SHADPS4_DBG_DRAW_VERTICES=3`, a measuring aid) the
GPU still has a third of its work: about 4 microseconds per draw for the state that changes
between draws, the other two thirds being the geometry and its pixels. The frame rate of that
view does not rise by it, though: there the game's own threads and the thread that translates
its draws (20 ms a frame) are the limit in the sandbox, where the emulator has three cores.

In a VR session the system holds the GPU at 545 MHz at most (level 4), and lets it go to 599
(level 5) only for apps that take part in "dynamic resolution": that ask it, from moment to
moment, at what size it wants their picture. The app asks (and up to 0.6 also showed the
picture at that size, see "The picture"); `dynamic_resolution=0` turns the asking off. Whether
the system grants the higher level shows in what `tools/quest-recorder.sh` keeps of a session
(`GPU=4/5`, `.../599MHz` in the `VrApi` lines, `Dynres boost enabled` among the reasons for the
GPU's maximum). In the second and third sessions it did: level 5, 599 MHz throughout.

The last level, 640 MHz, the system only gives to an app that also trades a processor level for
it, which is a line in the app's manifest and so a build of its own:
`quest-host/build.sh --trade-cpu-for-gpu`. The processor then tops out at 1.65 instead of
1.92 GHz, 14% less for 7% more GPU. In the second session the GPU was the one that ran out,
with the emulator using two of its three cores; but the thread that hands the game's drawing to
the GPU is one of the two, and it is the one a slower processor would hold up. Not tried in a
session; the default build does not trade.

The app also asks for the processor's "boost" level, which the system grants for the first 45
seconds and up to a fifth of the time after that (2.36 GHz): that is when the emulator
translates most of the game's code. `cpu_boost=0` turns it off.

Tried and dropped: FEX without x86 memory ordering (`SHADPS4_FEX_TSO=0`) - the game stops within
half a minute. The driver without its lowering of uniform buffers to constants
(`IR3_SHADER_DEBUG=nouboopt`) - the same GPU time. Not setting vertex layout, vertex and index
buffers and push constants again when they are what the command buffer already has (half of
those calls) - no difference to the GPU or to the thread that makes them.

The app has the core log, every five seconds, the frame rate, what a frame consists of and how
long it takes on each part of its way ("frame path", `SHADPS4_FRAME_STATS=1`). The tools under
"Testing on the headset" show where GPU and processor time go.

### The headset's own performance features

What Meta offers apps for speed, and what each can do for a game that is drawn by an emulator
(checked against Meta's documentation; the pages are in `build/docs/`):

- **Application SpaceWarp** has the app draw at half the display rate and the compositor make up
  every other frame. For that the app hands over, with every frame, a buffer that says for each
  pixel how it moved since the frame before, and the depth buffer; whatever is drawn without
  such motion vectors "appears to stutter". A game engine writes them in a pass of its own, from
  each object's transform in this frame and the last. This game has no such pass (among its
  render targets in the first level there is no velocity buffer), so the emulator would have to
  work out, for each of the game's 1800 draws a frame, where the same draw put its vertices a
  frame earlier, and draw all of it once more. That is a project of its own with an uncertain
  end, and the extra pass would cost frame rate that is already short of the exact half rate
  SpaceWarp insists on (60 for 120 Hz, 40 for 80 Hz, 36 for 72 Hz). Not done.
  What the compositor does do with every frame, at the display's rate, is turn it to where the
  head points by now. That is the same reprojection PlayStation VR used to show this game's 60
  frames at 120 Hz.
- **Fixed foveated rendering** makes the GPU draw the edges of the image an app renders into at
  a lower resolution. The image this app renders into only receives a copy of the finished
  picture, which is no work to speak of. The picture itself is drawn by the emulator into the
  game's own targets; there the driver could only do it in its tiled mode, which halves the
  frame rate of this game (it is the geometry that is expensive, not the pixels, and the game
  already draws at its lowest resolution, with the area the lenses cannot show masked out).
- **Super Resolution** is the better of the two filters the compositor can enlarge the picture
  with. Left to the system (the default up to 0.6) it was off two thirds of the time in a
  level; `sharpen=2` now asks for it unconditionally, the default is the emulator's own
  sharpening (see "The picture").
- **GPU and processor levels**: see above.

## The picture

In the third session the game was up to speed and the view was right, and the picture "looked
way worse" than on the console. It did, for four reasons, of which the size of the scene was
only one:

- **No anti-aliasing.** The console draws this game with multisampling (four colour samples
  and eight depth samples a pixel). On the Quest that is switched off (`msaa=1`): two samples
  cost 9 to 28% of a frame's time, four 28 to 40%, which is more than there is. Every edge was
  therefore as jagged as its pixels, and the headset's display, which has about two and a half
  pixels across for each of the picture's, shows every step. From 0.7 on the emulator smooths
  edges in the finished scene instead: where the game "resolves" a multisampled picture that
  the emulator holds with one sample a pixel, there is nothing to average, and the copy that
  used to stand in for it is now a filter that finds edges by their contrast and blends each
  pixel on one with its neighbour across it, by how far along the edge it sits (FXAA; it works
  on the scene before tone mapping, so a glaring pixel does not decide everything around it;
  `src/video_core/host_shaders/resolve_aa.frag`). It costs about 3% of a frame's time (1 ms at
  816x870) and is not tied to this game. `antialias=0` turns it off.
- **The size**, see above: 816x870 for half of the level.
- **Shown smaller.** Up to 0.6 the app showed the picture at the size the system recommended
  from moment to moment, 15% smaller in each direction whenever the GPU was busy, which in a
  level is always. That saved nothing worth having (the picture is copied once per frame of
  the game) and blurred what the game drew. Now the app still asks for the recommendation,
  which is what the system wants of an app before it lets the GPU run at its faster clocks,
  and shows the picture at full size. Whether the system still grants the faster clock (599
  MHz, "level 5") that way is the first thing to look for after the next session: `GPU=4/5`
  and `599MHz` in the `VrApi` lines that `tools/quest-recorder.sh` keeps.
  `dynamic_resolution=2` goes back to showing the picture at the recommended size.
- **No sharpening.** The headset was asked for its Super Resolution filter "when the system
  finds the GPU has time", and the system found that in a third of the level. Now the emulator
  sharpens each picture itself as it copies it to where the app takes it from (contrast
  adaptive sharpening; `post_process.frag`), which costs too little to measure and happens
  once per frame of the game instead of at every refresh. `sharpen=2` asks for Super
  Resolution on every refresh instead, whatever the GPU is doing (it takes about 0.7 ms of
  every refresh, a twentieth of the GPU at 90 Hz); `sharpen=0` leaves the picture soft.

`build/quest/picture-compare.png` shows three parts of the first level's picture as 0.6 showed
them, as 0.7 does in the heaviest views and in ordinary ones, and as a PlayStation 4 draws
them at its smallest and largest size (made from full-size dumps of the PC build by
`tools/picture-compare.py`).

How this compares with the console: a base PlayStation 4 shows this game at 60 frames a second,
960x1080 to 1440x1536, multisampled. The Quest 3 running it through an emulator shows the
levels at 30 frames a second, each frame for the same time, at 960x1080 to 1200x1280 in most
views and 816x870 in the heaviest, with edges smoothed by a filter instead of by multisampling;
lighter scenes at 45 frames a second and up to 1440x1536. Half the console's frame rate is what
the headset's GPU has in it for this game (a frame of the first level is 4 to 8 million
vertices in 750 to 2500 draws, 20 to 30 ms of GPU time at the smallest size); the picture is
now close to the console's at its smaller sizes.

## Sound

The game does all its sound through Sony's Ngs2 library, which the emulator only had as an empty
stub. `src/core/libraries/ngs2/ngs2_engine.cpp` implements what the game uses natively: sampler
voices (ATRAC9, HE-VAG, PCM), submixers, reverb, chorus/delay/pitch racks, mastering, and the
game's own effect callbacks. The game's 7.1 mix is rendered for the headset's ear speakers by a
virtual surround stage (`audio/surround_virtualizer.cpp`); `env=SHADPS4_VIRTUAL_SURROUND=0`
replaces it by a plain fold-down. The second mix the game produces for the television is not played.

The app plays each port on its own audio stream. The stream's buffer (60 ms) is what stands
between a game that is late for a moment and a gap in the sound: the emulator delivers as fast
as the stream takes it, and after a delay hands over what it missed at once, which fills the
buffer again. A stream that takes nothing at all (output suspended or rerouted) is not waited
for: its sound is dropped until it plays again, so the game never waits for sound nobody hears.
`host.log` has a line per stream every ten seconds: how much sound was delivered, dropped and
played, and how often the buffer ran dry. (In the second session the stream of the game's 3D
sound ran dry some 130 times in the ten seconds the first level took to load, and hardly ever
otherwise: the thread the game mixes it on, and the emulator's threads that pass sound on, had
no more claim to a processor than the game's helpers, which are busiest while a level loads.
They are now among the threads `SHADPS4_THREAD_NICE` puts first.)

(In the first session there was no sound at all: Android only starts to play a stream once its
buffer has been filled completely, and the app held back everything beyond a "cushion" that was
smaller than that.)

To check sound without listening: `SHADPS4_AUDIOOUT_DUMP=<seconds>` writes what every port plays
to WAV files in the emulator's user folder (`tools/wavstat.py <file> --png out.png` summarises one);
`SHADPS4_AUDIOOUT_STATS=1` logs every ten seconds how much of real time each port played and what
held it up.

## Microphone

The game listens to the microphone PlayStation VR has in its visor: blowing at things is one of
the ways to play with its world. The app passes the headset's own microphone on for that, and
asks for the permission the first time it starts; without it (or with `mic=0`) the game hears
silence, as it did before.

All the game does with the sound is measure how loud it is: 256 samples at a time, and from
their root mean square `rms` (1 being full scale) a strength of blowing
`min(1, 0.5 * ln(1 + 3.5 * 20 * log10(1 + rms / 1.5)))`. That is 1 from -9 dB on, a half at
-21 dB and a quarter at -30 dB. `host.log` says every ten seconds how loud the loudest moment was
on that scale, which is what to set `mic_gain` by should blowing do too little (or talking too
much). In an input script `mic=0.35` blows for as long as the line lasts, and
`SHADPS4_AUDIOIN_STATS=1` makes the emulator log what the game's port heard.

## Other firmware libraries

`src/core/libraries/json/json.cpp` implements the firmware's JSON library (libSceJson2), which the
emulator only stubbed. The game hands it the animation sequences of characters and sets of option
flags; with the stub every such text read as empty. `tools/tests/json_test.cpp` exercises it the
way the game calls it, and `SHADPS4_JSON_TRACE=<count>` logs what is parsed.

## PC test build

`tools/run-win.sh <seconds>` runs the game in the Windows build with a simulated headset. Useful
environment variables: `SHADPS4_VR_DEMO=1` (sweeps the head), `SHADPS4_INPUT_SCRIPT=<file>` (scripted
buttons, sticks, touchpad, head, controller and hand positions, a reset of the view, see
`shadps4-arm64-main/src/input/scripted_input.h`; examples in `build/dev/`). `tools/contact.mjs`
turns the automatic screenshots into a contact sheet.

`tools/pc-view-test.sh <name> <seconds> <"x,y,z"> [input script]` runs it with the head resting
at a given place and keeps pictures and log in `build/dev/view/<name>/`. For telling what the
game does with time and with the head, on a machine that is fast enough for anything:

| Setting | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `SHADPS4_DBG_FRAME_DELAY_MS=<ms>` | holds the game up by that much every frame (22 gives 43 frames a second, 32 gives 30) |
| `SHADPS4_SHOT_SECONDS=<n>[,<from>]` | a picture every n seconds by the clock, so that runs at different frame rates can be compared moment by moment |
| `SHADPS4_FRAME_STATS=1 SHADPS4_FRAME_STATS_EVERY=1` | frame rate and draws per frame every second: what the game shows over time, as a fingerprint of where it is |
| `SHADPS4_VR_REFRESH_RATE=<Hz>` | how often the emulated headset refreshes (60 to 120); the game draws half as many frames |
| `SHADPS4_VR_PACE=<2..6>` | how many of those refreshes every frame is given: 3 at 90 Hz makes 30 frames a second on the dot (without it the emulator chooses, which on a PC is always 2) |
| `SHADPS4_TITLE_TIMESTEP=0`, `SHADPS4_TITLE_RESOLUTION=<3..6 or title>` | the game's time step left alone; its scene held to one size (3 = 816x870 ... 6 = 1440x1536) or left to the game |
| `SHADPS4_MAX_MSAA=<1, 2, 4>` | the most samples a pixel gets; 1 is what the headset runs with, and has the emulator smooth edges itself unless `SHADPS4_RESOLVE_AA=0` |
| `SHADPS4_VR_SHARPEN=<0..1>` | how much the eyes' pictures are sharpened on their way out (the app sets 0.6) |

`tools/pc-dump-test.sh <name> <seconds> [NAME=value ...]` plays into the first level and keeps
everything the game has drawn at that moment, at full size, in `build/dev/dump/<name>/` (the
eyes' finished pictures are the `..._523ce0000_1440x1536_...` and `..._5245e0000_...` files,
the scene before the game enlarges it the `960x1080_R16G16B16A16Sfloat` ones, or whatever size
it was held to). `tools/crop.py` cuts the same part out of several of them and puts the cuts
side by side, `tools/picture-compare.py` makes the comparison in `build/quest/picture-compare.png`,
and `tools/aa_proto.py` is where edge smoothing, enlarging and sharpening were tried out on
such dumps before any of it was written for the GPU.

`build/dev/input-gametime.txt` and `input-playcheck.txt` are the scripts the time step was
checked with, `input-origin2.txt` the one that shows when the game takes stock of the head.

## Testing on the headset without wearing it

`tools/quest-sandbox-test.sh <seconds> [input script]` runs the core inside the app's sandbox with
scripted input and pulls log, screenshots and audio dumps to `build/quest/run/`;
`tools/quest-selftest.sh <seconds>` exercises the app's own launch, socket and frame-sharing code.
Neither needs the headset to be unlocked; only the immersive session itself does.

Settings of `quest-sandbox-test.sh` for looking into speed (all described at the top of the script):

| Setting | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `SHADPS4_FRAME_STATS=1` (as an argument) | frame rate, passes, draws and the frame path in `run/core.log`; `=2` also lists the render passes of a frame and which code ended each |
| always | `run/gpu.txt`: GPU load, GPU and processor clocks every five seconds |
| `ASTRO_GPUTRACE_AT=<s>` | the driver's own trace from that second on; `tools/gputrace.py run/gputrace.txt <fps>` sums it up per kind of render pass |
| `ASTRO_THREADS_AT=<s> ASTRO_THREAD_SAMPLES="1500 shadPS4:GpuComm"` | a sampling profile of one thread; `node tools/symbolize-stacks.mjs --thread shadPS4:GpuComm --profile` prints it |
| `ASTRO_AT="<s>:<command>;..."` | shell commands at given times, e.g. to switch driver options through `TU_DEBUG_FILE` |

The sandbox is not a VR session: the core may only use three processor cores there, and the GPU
clock follows the load instead of being held by the VR runtime.

Settings of `quest-selftest.sh` that make it more like one (given like the core's, as
`NAME=value` arguments):

| Setting | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `HOST_COMPOSITOR=<Hz>[,<n>[,<Mpx>]]` | a stand-in for the compositor: so many times a second a pass the size of the compositor's own (9 megapixels) and n - 1 small ones (n = 5), on a GPU context that comes before the emulator's. With it the GPU is the limit as in a session |
| `HOST_DISPLAY=<Hz>` | the test's loop goes round once per refresh of a display of that rate, tells the emulator of each as the app does, and counts for how many refreshes each frame of the game stayed the newest |
| `HOST_LOOK="<s>:<left>,<up>;..."` | where the head looks from which second on (degrees); `8:85,22;110:0,-12` finds the first level from the world map and then looks along it |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME=<folder>` | where the emulator keeps its data, saves among them. The self-test starts from nothing each time, so the game plays its prologue (four minutes); with a folder that holds a save it is in the first level after 75 seconds |
| `SHADPS4_VR_FOLLOW_DISPLAY=0` | the emulated headset keeps to its own clock although the host tells of its display's refreshes |

`quest-selftest.sh` gives the game's microphone a test signal (a second of noise every five);
`ASTRO_MIC=real` opens the headset's own instead, which stays silent while nobody wears it.
`ASTRO_FRESH=1` makes it unpack the runtime from the installed app first, as the app does on its
first start, instead of testing the core in `build/arm64`. (Both test scripts otherwise put that
build into the app's runtime folder and remove the folder's stamp, so that the app unpacks its
own again the next time it is started.)

`tools/quest-level-bench.sh <name> <seconds>` is the self-test set up for measuring: a display
and a compositor stand-in of 90 Hz (`BENCH_HZ=72` or `120` for others), a save that has the game
in the first level after 75 seconds (the folder `bench-data` in the app's files, a copy of the
sandbox tests' save), the head looking at the level sideways until second 110 and down its
whole length after that, which is its heaviest view. It keeps report, logs and the GPU's clock
in `build/quest/bench/<name>.*` and prints what `tools/quest-bench-read.sh <name>` prints:
frames a second by ten seconds, for how many refreshes frames were shown, every decision on
pace and size, and every ten seconds what frames took at what size with the GPU how busy.
(`tools/quest-gpu-watch.sh <seconds> <file>` on its own writes GPU load, clock and temperature
once a second.) The self-test does not take one of its own settings twice: give `HOST_DISPLAY`
and `HOST_COMPOSITOR` once.

`tools/quest-xrprobe.sh` goes as far into OpenXR as the runtime lets an app go with nobody
wearing the headset: it checks that the app finds the runtime and that the extensions the host
uses are there, and then runs the host itself for five seconds - session, swapchains, hand
trackers and the frame buffers shared with the emulator are created as in a real start, the
session (which stays idle) is asked for the refresh rates on offer, the performance levels and
the thread hints, and a test picture is copied into the swapchain's images and read back. On
Horizon OS 207 all of that succeeds (72, 80, 90 and 120 Hz on offer). What it cannot reach is the
session itself: frames on the display, head and hand tracking, the controller.

`tools/quest-drystart.sh <seconds> [settings file]` starts the app's own activity without showing
it: everything the app does when it is launched runs (settings, log files, OpenXR up to the idle
session, unpacking the runtime, the emulator with the game, sound), a controller that is not
there presses ✕ now and then (through the same code a real one's events go through), and the
`host.log` and `core.log` the app writes are pulled to `build/quest/drystart/` together with
pictures of what its status panel showed.

## Watching a real session

A session is played without a cable, so what the app cannot see itself is written down on the
headset: `tools/quest-recorder.sh start` leaves a small recorder running there (until the
headset is restarted; starting it again is harmless). Whenever the emulator runs it keeps, in
`/data/local/tmp/astro/sessions/<start time>/`, the VR runtime's own statistics (`VrApi` lines
once a second: frames shown and stale, processor and GPU level and clock, GPU time of the app
and of the compositor; `crcs` lines: every change of clock level and the reason for it), GPU
load, clock and temperature every two seconds, and the emulator's busiest threads with the cores
they ran on every thirty.

`tools/quest-recorder.sh pull`, with the headset back on the cable, fetches all of it to
`build/quest/sessions/`, with the app's `host.log` and `core.log` next to the newest session.
`status` says whether the recorder runs and what it has.

What to read first after a session with 0.7: in `core.log`, "Frames are given ... refreshes"
and "The scene is drawn at" (how often pace and size changed, and between what), and the
ten-second lines "The title's clock" (frames at 33.3 ms with the GPU under 90% busy is the level
running as intended; frames longer than they are given with the GPU at 100% is the GPU short).
In the recorder's `VrApi` lines, `GPU=` and the clock after it (level 5, 599 MHz, is what the
app had so far while it showed the picture at the recommended size; it now only asks for that
size), `FPS=` against the display's 90, and `Stale`. In `host.log`, the "controller:" lines
(vendor 1356 is Sony) and "picture shown at" (1440x1536, and what the system recommended).

(`tools/quest-session-watch.sh` does the same from the PC, for a headset that stays connected.)

Should the game stop drawing, the app's panel says so after twenty seconds ("No new picture
from the game for ... seconds") instead of "Loading...", and the emulator writes what each of
its threads was doing into `core.log`; `node tools/symbolize-stacks.mjs <core.log>` turns that
into function names. The one such stop met so far is described in
`shadps4-arm64-main/src/video_core/renderer_vulkan/vk_master_semaphore.cpp`.
