The Linux runtime (everything from glibc to the Turnip driver above) is taken unchanged from
the [Bachata S4 v0.2.4](https://github.com/JICA98/Bachata-S4/releases/tag/v0.2.4) release,
whose notice (`shadps4-arm64-main/NOTICE.android-runtime.md`) and lock files
(`shadps4-arm64-main/runtime/locks/`) record the exact packages.

## PC build (`AstroQuest-<version>-PC-VR-Windows.zip`)

The emulator needs the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime, which is not included: it comes with the
[Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

## Source of the GPL and LGPL parts

The source of AstroQuest itself is this repository, at the tag of each release. For the GPL
and LGPL parts made by others (the Linux runtime in the Quest app, the libraries built into
the emulators from `shadps4-arm64-main/externals`, and PkgTool), a copy of the exact source
used is available on request for three years from each release: open an issue on this
repository.

## Not included

No part of ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission, of the PlayStation 4 system software, or any key or other
copyrighted console file is part of this repository or of its releases.
