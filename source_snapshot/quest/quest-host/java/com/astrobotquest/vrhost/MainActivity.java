/**
 * Hosts the PS4 emulator core on a Meta Quest: installs its Linux runtime, starts it, feeds it a
 * paired DualSense as the DualShock 4 the game expects (buttons, sticks, touchpad, motion
 * sensors in; rumble and light bar colour out) and lets the native side show its frames in the
 * headset.
 *
 * Files the user provides live in the app's external folder
 * (/sdcard/Android/data/com.fgovr.quest/files):
 *   games/SERIAL/eboot.bin ...   the extracted game (or /data/local/tmp/fgovr/games/SERIAL)
 *   data/shadPS4/                 the emulator's own folder (sys_modules, saves, logs)
 *   vrhost.txt                    optional settings, see readSettings
 * and what the app leaves there for looking at afterwards:
 *   host.log, core.log            this app's log and the emulator's output of the last start
 *   host.prev.log, core.prev.log  the same of the start before

     *                          40 or 30 at 120. At 72 and 80 Hz there is only the one pace
     *                          (36, 40): frames are never given more refreshes than still
     *                          makes 30 a second, below that the game draws as it can
     *   pace=2                 leave it to the game how many refreshes a frame takes, as up to
     *                          version 0.6: it takes two, and one more whenever a frame is
     *                          late, so frames last unevenly where it only just keeps up. A
     *                          larger number holds every frame to that many refreshes. Without

     *                          own choice. Without this the emulator chooses: the fastest pace
     *                          at which 960x1080 (the console's own smallest) fits the GPU's
     *                          time, 816x870 only where that would mean fewer than 30 frames a
     *                          second, and then the largest size that fits that pace
     *   antialias=0            leave edges as jagged as the game draws them here. The console
     *                          multisamples (see msaa), which this GPU cannot afford; by
     *                          default the emulator smooths edges in the finished scene
     *                          instead, for a fraction of the cost
     *   real_time=0            let the game count time in frames, as it does on the console:
     *                          it then runs in slow motion whenever a frame takes longer than
     *                          a sixtieth of a second, which here is always. By default the
     *                          emulator has it run by the clock
     *   hands=0                do not use hand tracking to place the controller; it is then held
     *                          at a fixed spot in front of the player
     *   sharpen=0              leave the picture as soft as it gets from being shown larger
     *                          than it was drawn. By default (1) the emulator sharpens it once
     *                          per frame of the game. 2 has the headset do it instead, with its
     *                          Super Resolution filter on every refresh: finer, but it takes
     *                          about a twentieth of the GPU from the game. 3 is the same left
     *                          to the system, which drops it when the GPU is busy (always, in
     *                          a level). 4 is the headset's plainer filter
     *   cubic=1                have the headset enlarge the picture with a cubic filter instead
     *                          of a linear one: sharper, for some GPU time on every refresh
     *   stick_touchpad=0       stop using the right stick as a finger on the touchpad
     *   motion=0               ignore the controller's motion sensors
     *   rumble=0               no vibration
     *   msaa=4                 let the game multisample as it does on the console (1, 2 or 4).
     *                          The default of 1 turns that off: it is by far the most expensive
     *                          thing the headset's GPU is asked to do
     *   stats=1                keep a small panel in view with the game's frame rate, the
     *                          display's refresh rate and whether the hands are seen
     *   predict_ms=25          how far beyond the next refresh the head pose given to the game
     *                          is predicted (0 to 80). More if the edges of the picture show
     *                          when turning the head, less if the world wobbles
     *   dynamic_resolution=0   do not ask the system what size it recommends for the
     *                          picture. Asking is what the system wants of an app before it
     *                          lets the GPU run at its faster clocks; the picture is shown at
     *                          full size all the same (the game draws its scene smaller when
     *                          the GPU is short, which is what saves time). 2 also shows the
     *                          picture at the recommended size, as up to version 0.6
     *   cpu_boost=0            do not ask for the processor's fastest clock, which the system
     *                          otherwise grants for the first 45 seconds and now and then
     *   fov=100                have the game draw that many percent of the field of view it
     *                          draws on a PlayStation VR (100 by 103 degrees an eye), and show
     *                          it over that much: the same pixels over fewer degrees is a sharper
